data_simulations
================

This is a large project where a colleague (Andrew Bray) and I are composing simulations of data to 'check' economic models 
that are taught in introductory and intermediate microeconomics. Some of the data simulations will have little to do with 
economic theory, but rather to do with interesting historical data that presents interesting problems for economic theory
to explain, such as the various 'hockey stick' graphs that we will be putting here. 

Other simulations will involve data to show students some basic ideas in economic theory, from demand curves based on price 
and quantity data, to data on industry behavior (in the future).
